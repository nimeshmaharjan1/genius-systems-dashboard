First of all, I would to apologise for being late in the submission of the assessment. The main reason for the delay in the submission was the deadline for my final year project which on the 27th April along with another deadline for a groupwork which is on 4th May due to which I was not able to implement the pagination and single user detail functionality into this assessment.
This project has been developed in React Js with Sass preprocessor and custom CSS (proper styling could not be implemented due the above specified reason),  along with the following dependencies:
  * **Recharts**: used for the development of charts for the active/unactive users along with users subscriptions plan statistics visualization. <br>
  * **React-table**: used for the creation of tables for the vizualization of users in the dashboard and in the users page. Furthermore, the sorting and filtering functionalities also have been implemented into the table excluding the pagination functionallity.
  * **Sass**
  * **Material UI React** has been installed but not used in the project. It was installed to use its data grid component, instead react-table has been used.

Please run npm install to install the dependencies before running the application.

The following images are the screenshots of the application UI.
